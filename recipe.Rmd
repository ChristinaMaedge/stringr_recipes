# Detect matches

If you want to detect the presence of a pattern match in a string, you use the str_detect() command.
```{r}
str_detect(vec_name, "pizza")
```

If your dataset was bigger, it might be annoying to look through the whole output. So instead of only detecting if there is a recipe containing the word "pizza", you may want to count the recipes including "pizza" in their names. str_count() helps you to count the number of matches in a string. 
```{r}
str_count(vec_name, "pizza")
```

Contrary to expectations, the output is not a number but ...



Now we want to find the indexes of strings that contain a pattern match by using str_which().
```{r}
str_which(vec_name, "pizza")
```

For locating the positions of pattern matches in a string use str_locate().
```{r}
str_locate(vec_name, "pizza")
```
